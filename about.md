## Mission

BitDevs Torino is a monthly meetup and developer-community rooted in the spirit of BitDevs: to bring together students, developers and researchers in the Turin region who are interested in the research and development of Bitcoin and related protocols. We meet on the first Thursday of every month at 19:00–20:00, in English, for discussion, presentations and open-source collaboration.

## Community Values

- **Technical depth & curiosity:** We aim to go beyond casual discussion — digging into protocol design, research papers, open-source code, and development practices. This aligns with the original BitDevs mandate of fostering a community for those interested in discussing and participating in the research and development of Bitcoin and related protocols.
- **Openness & inclusiveness:** While we lean technical, everyone is welcome — students, professional developers, hobbyists, and those newer to the field.
- **Peer learning & collaboration:** We encourage participants to both present and listen, to share projects, challenges and ideas, and to form working groups where desired.
- **Local-global mindset:** Although based in Turin (Torino), we connect with the larger BitDevs community and use English as the primary language so we can interface with international participants.
